# [Wordle Suggestions](https://wordle.spacefox.rocks)
> For those moments when you need extra inspiration.

# How to use
The web application will provide suggestions for [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) based on the information you have from previous stages. These suggestions take into account the new word list after the acquisition from the New York Times.

1. In the first section, marked with a ðŸŸ©, place in the correct order the
   letters that are in the word **in the correct position**. Leave empty spaces for those unknown.
2. In the second section, marked with a ðŸŸ¨, write the letters that are in the
   word with an **unknown position**.
3. In the third section, marked with a â¬›, write the letters that are **not** in
   the word.

The suggested words in the list could be the chosen word.

# Getting started
```
git clone git@github.com:threkk/prune.js.git

npm install
npm run dev
```

# Motivation
English is not (neither will be) my mother tongue, so sometimes I get stuck with
rare words. I used to use a combination of `grep` and `/usr/share/dict/` to help
me at those times, but I thought other people could also benefit.
